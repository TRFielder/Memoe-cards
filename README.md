# Memory Cards

This project was created as part of The Odin Project's full stack JavaScript path, with the intention being to get some experience using React.

All components except the header and footer (which were recycled from another project of mine) are functional components, relying on useState and hooks to create a playable game

The game keeps track of the user's high score based on successfully clicked cards, and gets the data for the cards from the [Genshin Dev API](https://genshin.dev/)
